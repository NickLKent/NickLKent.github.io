I am a sophomore at Macalester College pursuing a major in data science, and minors in computer science and economics. Please take a look through this website if you would like to learn more about myself and some of my projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am just wrapped up my software year, and having been gaining many skills in the realms of data science, computer science, economics. I enjoy data exploration and analysis in a variety of field and topics, and hope to continue to grow my skillset."
