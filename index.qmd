Welcome to my personal website, created using **Quarto** in R/RStudio. My name is **Nick Kent**. I am a sophomore at Macalester College pursuing a major in data science, and minors in computer science and economics. Please take a look through this website if you would like to learn more about myself and some of my projects.

I am just wrapped up my sophomore year, and have been gaining many skills in the realms of data science, computer science, economics. I enjoy data exploration and analysis in a variety of field and topics, and hope to continue to grow my skillset.
